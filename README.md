# OpenInteractions

**Open Source AI Infrastructure for Voice & Vision Interactions**

OpenInteractions is an open-source infrastructure project focused on building the foundational layers for AI-powered voice and vision interactions. We're developing a three-layer architecture that handles the complex Engage Layer (STT, TTS, Fast LLM) and Think Layer (Reasoning, Context) while you focus on business logic in the User Adapter.

## 🚀 Our Vision

We envision a future where developers can build AI voice and vision applications in hours, not months. Our mission is to democratize access to powerful AI infrastructure—open source, scalable, and secure by default.

> 🎯 **Months to Hours**: Reduce development time dramatically  
> 🧠 **Three-Layer Architecture**: Engage, Think, and User Adapter layers  
> 🔓 **Open Source**: Community-driven development with full transparency  
> 🛡️ **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in security, compliance, and privacy features
