# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [community@openinteractions.live](mailto:community@openinteractions.live). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the community leaders. All reports will be kept confidential.

### What to Include in Your Report

* Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well
* Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing
* Any additional context that is available to you
* If you believe this incident is ongoing
* Any other relevant information

### Where to Report

* **Email**: [community@openinteractions.live](mailto:community@openinteractions.live)
* **Discord**: Contact moderators in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3U6Qy6nz)
* **GitHub**: Use the "Report" feature on GitHub for issues/comments

### What Happens After You Report

You will receive an email from the community team acknowledging receipt within 24-48 hours, and we may contact you to follow up on the incident and ask any clarifying questions.

The community team will meet to review the incident and determine:
* What happened
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
* Who the bad actor was
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the working groups' immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events, they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:
* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred)
* A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a listserv)
* A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved with a public announcement of the violation
* A public announcement of the violation
* An imposed vacation from the working group's forums, GitHub, Discord, etc. for a specified period of time
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all working group spaces (GitHub, Discord, etc.)
* A request for a public apology to the community

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, if the working group decides that no violation took place, or if the working group decides to take no action, the working group will deliver that response to the reporter. Likewise, if the reporter is dissatisfied with the working group's response, the reporter can appeal to the working group, or to any member of the working group, and the working group will review the decision.

## Addressing Grievances

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the community team with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
